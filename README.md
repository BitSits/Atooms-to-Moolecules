The levels in the game takes place in different parts of lab. I am kinda still working on the levels and stuffs. The game is more advanced version of my previous game [Moolecule] (small prototype). 

The game have a "LAB Setup" where you can build your own lab sets and play around. Where you can use the equipments, add atooms and have lots of fun. This section was basically build to check the behavior of the lab equipments. 

Here are some screen shot
